Analyzing the sentiment of tweets

The goal of this program is to allow Python to analyzes twitter information.

Textual data and the computational means of processing itand extracting information is also increasingly more important in areas such as business, humanities,social sciences, etc. 

Twitter has become very popular, with many people “tweeting” aspects of their daily lives. This “flow
of tweets” has recently become a way to study or guess how people feel about various aspects of the
world or their own life. 

For example, analysis of tweets has been used to try to determine how certaingeographical regions may be voting – this is done by analyzing the content, the words, and phrases, in tweets. Similarly, analysis of keywords or phrases in tweets can be used to determine how popular or unpopular a movie might be. This is often referred to as sentiment analysis.

I built a program that performs simple sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The Twitter data contains comments from individuals about how they feel about their lives and comes from individuals across the continental United States.
